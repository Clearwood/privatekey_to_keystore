# privatekey_to_keystore
A simple webapp which enables a user to create an encrypted keystore file from a private key.
It can be accessed via github pages:
https://clearwood.github.io/privatekey_to_keystore/

I am using Keythereum to create the keystore file from the provided private key.
That project can be found over here: https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum
